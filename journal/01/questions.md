# Foundations of Web Development
01. In your own words, why do we use Git?
    > | To store the code that you have coded, and be able to keep multiple versions so that multiple developers can work on the same projects.|

02. In the terminal, what is the command `mkdir` used for?
    > | Making a directory. ðŸ˜Ž |

03. What is a ***pseudo-class*** and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use?
    > | Makes it so that when an element is in a specified "special-state", the class will be active on the element specified by the tag.s |

04. What is ***specificity*** and how might you use it to your benefit?
    > | Specificity allows CSS to know which value of a property to apply if multiple are given, so you can utilize different classes on the same element with two different values for the same property without having to change the property on one of the classes. |

05. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the `!important` feature?
    > | If you use the !important feature too much, there would be too many instances of different values on one property that would break specificity and CSS wouldn't know which to use.|

06. What are the three components that makeup a `CSS` rule? <br> Example:

    ```css
        h1 {
            color: rgba(255, 210, 33, .75);
        }
    ```

    > | Selector(h1), Property(color), value(rgba(255, 210, 33, .75)) |

07. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website, and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?
    > | Good design can not only improve traffic through the webpage that you're designing but it can also be inclusive to disabled people. Good design also makes your work seem more professional and attractive to the average viewer/user and it can keep them on the site for longer periods of time the more attractive the website is. Some things that design could convey by itself is accessibility, which allows users to understand the flow of the website easier. |

08. What is the purpose of ***wireframing***?
    > | Wireframing is for setting up the "skeleton" of the webpage and to give a rough outline of the elements, accessibility of the page, and functionality so that the developer can go back into the code and fine tune the looks of the website to match what they need once they've blocked it out. |

09. Do you think wireframes are worth the time, energy, and effort that they require? Why or Why not?
    > | I definitely think that wireframing is worth the effort it requires because you can work on projects in steps that way and it gives you the ability to create a rough "sketch" or "draft" of your website that you can go and fine tune. This way, you can work in small batches of code to make sure that you can debug as you go. |

10. Define the display `:flex property:`
    > | Flex allows for containers themselves to decide how their children inside of the container align and position themselves within the confines of the container. |

11. What `CSS` properties affect the size of a box model?
    > | Margin and padding will both effect the size of the box-model in different ways. Margin will add space to the outside of the box model, and will push other elements away from the box while padding will add space to the inside of the box-model and expand the size of the box at the same time. |
