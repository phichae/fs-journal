# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
I think I understand the use of CSS, and the structure of HTML much better than I did coming into the course, and that makes me feel much better about what I'm doing.
- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?
I think it is a shock how naturally HTML and CSS are coming to me, however I think that once we start on the other languages that we will use throughout the course I will definitely have to put in even more work to get even the basics of other languages down.
- What are you struggling with?
I think the biggest thing I'm struggling with is memorizing properties in CSS and classes that BootStrap introduces, however I think that as I practice more, this will become less of an issue.
- What would you count as a victory?
I think overall, gaining more experience and practicing more is helping me a lot and really hooking me into the field of software development and I become a little more interested in what I'm doing everyday as I see myself succeeding, and I can't wait to learn more about this field.
