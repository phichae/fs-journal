01. What are the Pillars of Object Oriented Programming (`OOP`)?
  
  > | Encapsulation and message passing.|

02. How does `export` differ from `export default`?
  
  > | You can only have one default export on a class while there are multiple exports you can code on a regular export. |

03. What is Encapsulation?
  
  > | Encapsulation is when you bundle data and logic together so that the access to data and important business logic is kept secure, and minimal. |

04. What are some of the benefits of the `Proxy` object that we are using in our structure for applications?
  
  > | We can basically be more secure with out logic in general and keep our appState in the most protected layer, as its supposed to be. |

05. What the difference between a `class` and an instance of a `class`?
  
  > | An instance of a class is just one use of the class based on whatever member or property of that class that you're calling. |

06. What is a computed Property?
  
  > | A property where we have changed the value of an input or piece of data based on certain criteria that we as developers have set the requirements for. |

07. What is the purpose of the `MVC` pattern?
  
  > | To build well-structured and maintainable applications. |

08. What is the job of the `Controller` in the `MVC` Pattern?
  
  > | To handle user input and updates to the view, according to changes in the model. |

09. What is the job of the `Service` in `MVC`?
  
  > | To handle changes that the user causes in the appState and to keep the business logic of your application encapsulated. |

10. What is the job of the `Model` in `MVC`?
  
  > | To give a 'blueprint for the data that is to be stored and displayed.' |
