# Understanding Asynchronous Code, and API's
01. What is the difference between `asynchronous` code and `synchronous` code?

  > | Asynchronous code means that the code awaits something to happen before running to the next line and giving the reults of the next bit of code. |

02. What is an event listener?

  > | An event listener is a method that will call a function when a specified event happens. |

03. What does *REST* stand for, and in simple terms what does it mean??

  > | Representational State Transfer, it means that when a user makes a request to a server through the api, that the server sends back a representation of the data requested, not the actual data. |

04. What is a callback / higher order function?

  > | A callback or higher order function is one that takes time to complete, longer than a usual function, and waits for something to be completed. |

05. What is a `promise`? How do you capture an error from a `promise`?

  > | A promise is a request for data that can either be resolved or rejected. |

06. Name three processes used to make requests over `HTTP`?

  > | POST, PUT, DELETE |

07. What does the `API` acronym stand for?

  > | API stands for Application Programming interface. |

08. What must you do in order to `await` a promise inside of a function?

  > | First, you have to make sure the whole function is Asynchronous in the first place so that your application knows to run the code after it gets a response. |

09. What is the purpose of encapsulation in programming?

  > | The purpose of encapsulation is to make sure the programming that is done stays object-oriented, and to maintain the security of the data that our site will use. |

10. What is `HTTP` response code for a successful request?

  > | 200 |

11. What is a 400 error?

  > | A 400 error could be caused by a bad request made by the client to the server, that the server has deemed won't work to retreive information, for example, if your request forms the wrong URL, then a 400 error is likely to occur. |
