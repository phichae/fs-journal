# HTML

DESIGN AROUND MOBILE FIRST!

HTML = STRUCTURE OF YOUR SITE

! - skeleton of the page
//<title> in the <head> How you change the name of the page in the browser: default is (Document)
In the head tag, use link to add favicon (icon on the browser tab)

Things you want the user to see, put in the body tags.
HEADER element holds things like the navbar in the body of the website. (Most websites have a header, main and a footer)
Inside the header <nav> is for the navbar

<main> - all of the content of our website
  - block out your website using <section>
    * use .x and .y to further block out within a section to seperate different elements

  - tag different sections with different classes to be able to identify them seperately

<footer> - about us/ contact info/ sponsored by/ powered by

build in structure! <div> is the easiest way to do this, group like information that you want together inside sections!
give pieces of information classes, gives you easy access to the style of each piece of information

!ORGANIZATION AND STRUCTURE!

class="d-flex" - default term for display-flex
